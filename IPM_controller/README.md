## All-at-once Interior Point Method

## Local Solution Method
**NOTE**: Requires MATLAB. Run the main file, which implements the all-at-once Interior Point Method (IPM):
```commandline
>> run_local_solution
```
This will generate several plots for both normal and pathological activity. Navigate to the `../experiments/local_solution/` folder to see plots.
